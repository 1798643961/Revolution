# Revolution
Revolution is a mod that adds groups of humans called "tribes" to Minecraft. Tribes have their own unique language, genetics, and adaptations based on the location that they spawned in. Individually, humans within these tribes learn about the environment around them and communicate this to their fellow tribesmen, allowing the tribe as a whole to adapt to a changing environment.

## Tribes
* Spawn about 12 to 30 chunks apart.
* Contain about 8 to 26 humans per tribe.
* Humans in a tribe look a lot alike.
* Store home location, which changes when food supplies are low.
* Home locations are roofed spaces with at least 64 air blocks.
* Oldest tribe member is the leader.
* Tribe members are designed for survival in their home biome.

## Humans
